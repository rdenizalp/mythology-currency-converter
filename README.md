# Mythology Currency Converter

A mythology-inspired iOS currency converter built with SwiftUI.
This app allows users to convert between fictional currencies named after mythological gods.

The goal of this project was to practice modern iOS development using SwiftUI
while building a clean, simple, and themed mobile application.
The original idea was adapted and redesigned with a mythology-based concept,
including custom currency names and UI text.

## Features
